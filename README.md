CSS Pixel Cat Maker: Pick a kitty, pick a color, boom! 🐱✨  

**What?**  

The project started as a way for me to learn Jinja for email development. I created a bunch of cats that were personalized based on a few customer properties. As a result, I sent out their own cat to each member of my team. As it was designed for emails, I coded each pixel as a separate `<td>`. I wanted to make sure it was fully supported in all email clients.  

As I really liked the result, I decided to adjust it a bit so I could publish the cats on the internet for everyone to enjoy. I swapped `<td>`s for `<div>`s and added the option to change cat features with JavaScript.  

**But...**  

Yes, this isn't practical.  

Yes, there are better ways to do such things.  

Yes, I had fun doing it anyway 😄
